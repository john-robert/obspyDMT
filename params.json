{"name":"obspyDMT","tagline":"A Python Toolbox for Retrieving and Processing of Massive Seismological Datasets","body":"obspyDMT (obspy Data Management Tool) is a command line tool for retrieving, processing and management of massive seismological data in a fully automatic way which can be run in serial or in parallel. \r\n\r\nThis tool is developed to mainly address the following tasks automatically: \r\n\r\n1. Retrieval of waveforms (MSEED or SAC), stationXML/response files and metadata from FDSN and ArcLink archives. This could be done in *serial* or in *parallel* for single or large requests.\r\n2. Supports both event-based and continuous requests.\r\n3. Extracting the information of all the events via user-defined options (time span, magnitude, depth and event location) from IRIS.\r\n4. Updating existing archives (waveforms, stationXML/response files and metadata).\r\n5. Processing the data in *serial* or in *parallel* (e.g. *removing the trend of the time series, tapering, filtering and Instrument correction*).\r\n6. Management of large seismic datasets.\r\n7. Plotting tools (events and/or station locations, ray coverage (event-station pair), epicentral-distance plots for all archived waveforms and seismicity maps).\r\n8. Exploring stationXML files by plotting the instrument response for all stages and/or for each stage.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the project and a tutorial about the code, refer to:\r\nhttps://github.com/kasra-hosseini/obspyDMT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
