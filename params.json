{"name":"obspyDMT","tagline":"","body":"obspyDMT (ObsPy Data Management Tool) is a command line tool for retrieving, processing and management of massive seismic data in a fully automatic way which could be run in serial or in parallel. Moreover, complementary processing and managing tools have been designed and introduced in addition to the obspyDMT options.\r\n\r\nThis tool is developed to mainly address the following tasks automatically:\r\n1. Retrieval of waveforms (MSEED or SAC), response files and metadata from IRIS and ORFEUS (via ArcLink) archives. This could be done in serial or in parallel for single or large requests.\r\n2. Supports event-based and continuous requests.\r\n3. Extracting the information of all the events via user-defined options (time span, magnitude, depth and event location) from IRIS and EMSC (European Mediterranean Seismological Centre).\r\n4. Updating the existing archives (waveforms, response files and metadata).\r\n5. Processing the data in serial or in parallel (e.g. Tapering, removing the trend of the time series, filtering and Instrument correction).\r\n6. Management of large seismic datasets.\r\n7. Plotting tools (events and/or station locations, Ray coverage (event-station pair), epicentral-distance plots for all archived waveforms and seismicity maps).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
