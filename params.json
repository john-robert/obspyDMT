Retrieval of waveforms (MSEED or SAC), response files and metadata from IRIS_ and ORFEUS (via ArcLink) archives. This could be done in *serial* or in *parallel* for single or large requests.\r\n2. Supports event-based and continuous requests.\r\n3. Extracting the information of all the events via user-defined options (time span, magnitude, depth and event location) from IRIS.\r\n4. Updating the existing archives (waveforms, response files and metadata).\r\n5. Processing the data in *serial* or in *parallel* (e.g. *Tapering, removing the trend of the time series, filtering and Instrument correction*).\r\n6. Management of large seismic datasets.\r\n7. Plotting tools (events and/or station locations, Ray coverage (event-station pair), epicentral-distance plots for all archived waveforms and seismicity maps).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
